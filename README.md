Frontend mentor challenge - QR code component

This is my solution for the Frontend Mentor Challenge - QR code component.

# What I've learned

There's something wrong with the box-shadow but I can't figure out what. Is it too big? Too small? Too dark? I'm not sure and it drove me crazy until I gave up and found the current one acceptable. The html file that came with the challenge also had an attribution class/section that is essentially just 'hey this is from x and it's coded by y' and I included that in the beginning, but ran into problems and so removed it.

I had both the attributions and the qrcode in the body, then I applied flexbox to center the qrcode, and just ignored the attributions thinking I'd deal with it later, but lo and behold, I had no clue how to make it go to the bottom of the page without messing up the already done qrcode component. I originally tried giving it an margin-top of auto and it went to the bottom, but moved the qrcode to the top and I previously had a bad habit of just adding position:relative to everything that I wanted to move independently because that was what worked. lol
